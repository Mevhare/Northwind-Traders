# Introduction
Northwind Traders is a fictitious gourmet food supplier. They are a global import and export company that specializes in supplying high-quality gourmet food products to restaurants, cafes, and specialty food retailers around the world.

# Challenge Objective
As part of your role, you've been tasked with building a top-level KPI dashboard for the executive team. Its purpose should be to allow them to quickly understand the company's performance in key areas, including:
- Sales trends
- Product performance
- Key customers
- Shipping costs

The dashboard should be built to evolve and accommodate new data over time, but you've been encouraged by your manager to have insights & recommendations ready to share with the VPs. 

# Presentation
The dashboard consists of three pages; sales, orders and shipping, each showing different KPIs such as Year-Over-Year difference %, Month-Over-Month difference %, Average Order Value (AOV), Average Delivery Time and Late Deliveries. These are essential for monitoring sale trends, product performance and for controlling shipping costs while maintaining standards.

There is also a filter that enables users look at data between the months from July 2013 to May 2015.

Below are images of the dashboard;
